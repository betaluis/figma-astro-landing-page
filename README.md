# figma-astro-landing-page

This tutorial and project is based on a tutorial given by Chris at "coding-in-public" on youtube.com.  

It is still in the works but upon completion it will have all the steps necessary to complete the project at your own pace. Use these steps to challenge yourself a little more than just watching a video and copying everthing the instructor is doing.

All steps will be found in the "notes" folder.

The notes tell you exactly what to do, but you have the ability to build beyond what is being taught and exercise your creativity.
